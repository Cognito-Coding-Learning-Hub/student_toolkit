âœ¨ Example Scenarios

ðŸ”´ Red Team (Attackerâ€™s POV):

    Recon target:
    nmap -A 192.168.1.0/24

    Brute-force SSH:
    hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.1.10 ssh

ðŸ”µ Blue Team (Defenderâ€™s POV):

    Investigate suspicious network traffic:
    tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.1.10

    Audit Linux box for weaknesses:
    lynis audit system
